# Movie-Theatre-App-Design
UI/UX design for a movie theatre app

## Project Overview

**Purpose**
The movie ticketing app was designed to reimagine the mobile cinema experience by streamlining the ticket booking process, reducing friction, and enhancing user satisfaction. The goal was to create a user-centric platform that allows moviegoers to effortlessly discover films, select seats, pre-order snacks, and access digital ticketsâ€”all within a visually engaging and intuitive interface. The app addresses common frustrations such as long queues, unclear navigation, and limited personalization, with a focus on accessibility and convenience.
**Your Role**
I led the end-to-end design process, wearing multiple hats across the UX spectrum:
**UX Researcher:** Conducted user interviews, developed personas, and synthesized usability study findings to identify key pain points and behavioral patterns.
**UI Designer:** Crafted the visual language, designed high-fidelity screens, and ensured accessibility compliance across the interface.
**Prototype Developer:** Built interactive flows in Figma, iterated based on feedback, and prepared the design for developer handoff.
**Usability Analyst:** Designed and executed an unmoderated usability study, analyzed task completion rates, and implemented iterative improvements.

**Tools Used**
**Figma:** For wireframing, UI design, and interactive prototyping

**Timeline**
The project spanned 6 weeks, broken down into key milestones:

**Week- Milestone**
1- Research planning, persona development, competitive analysis
2- User interviews, journey mapping, pattern identification
3- Wireframing and information architecture
4- UI design and accessibility refinement
5- Usability testing and iteration
6- Final prototype development and case study documentation
